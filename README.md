# Flow IO

![CI](https://github.com/launchflow/flow/actions/workflows/python_ci.yaml/badge.svg)

Flow IO is an open source framework to make it easier to for developers to
connect different resources to different frameworks. By using
Flow IO users can focus on writing their specific framework logic as opposed
to figuring out how exactly to connect to different resource types.

## IO Connector Support

Below are all resource / framework IO connections we support. If you would
like any additional frameworks or resources supported please file a
GitHub issue!
